This project is an immersive dive into transportation website development. Utilizing Node.js and React, we're constructing a platform reminiscent of popular services like Uber and Careem. As we build, we're also mastering the art of collaboration using GitHub and Git, equipping ourselves with essential skills in version control and team-based development.

Documenting our learning journey comprehensively, I'm crafting detailed notes covering every aspect we encounter. This structured format ensures easy access for future revisions, reinforcing our understanding and facilitating swift recall whenever needed.
